--- 8 bit discrete BJT processor ---

Harvard architecture
8 bit word size
16 bit program address space (EEPROM)
16 bit working memory (SRAM):
 - 8 bit address width
 - 256 banks (switchable via bank register)
 - Bank 256 reserved for call stack

CPU main data path goes only through the ALU.
Registers are not directly connected - register transfers are facilitated by ALU operations, e.g. add 0.
